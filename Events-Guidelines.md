# Introduction

This document highlights the events page guidelines for use on the Cilium project's website.

## Objectives

The objectives of adding events to the Cilium project's website is to raise awareness of physical and virtual events that:

- Share project news, roadmap updates, news releases, and user stories
- Educate on project updates
- Share information on Cilium how-tos, demos, etc that are valuable to the community
- Promote awareness for the Cilium project to a broader audience
- Drive community engagement and participation in the project

## Guidelines

For all Cilium events, we remain a neutral project, independent of any company. All events that want to be added to the website need to abide by the following guidelines:

- Adhere to the project's (or similar) code of conduct and respect user privacy and security
- The event must not be about a vendor product
- Activities should be open to the public to benefit the ecosystem as a whole
- Events should focus primarily on Cilium
- Events should be run or approved by a Cilium Committer
