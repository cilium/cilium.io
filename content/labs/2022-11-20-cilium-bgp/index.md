title: 'BGP on Cilium'
ogSummary: 'Learn how to connect your Kubernetes Clusters with your on-premises network using BGP.
As Kubernetes becomes more pervasive in on-premise environments, users increasingly have both traditional applications and Cloud Native applications in their environments.
In order to connect them together and allow outside access, a mechanism to integrate Kubernetes and the existing network infrastructure running BGP is needed. Cilium offers native support for BGP, exposing Kubernetes to the outside and all the while simplifying usersâ€™ deployments.'
