title: 'SCTP on Cilium'
ogSummary: 'SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a transport-layer protocol used for communication between applications. It is similar to TCP, but it provides additional features such as multi-homing and message fragmentation. Applications that require reliable, ordered delivery of data, but also need the ability to handle multiple streams of data simultaneously can use SCTP. SCTP is primarily used by service providers and mobile operators.
While SCTP support for Kubernetes Services, Endpoint and NetworkPolicy was introduced in Kubernetes 1.12, you still need a CNI to support it. Good news: basic support for SCTP was introduced in Cilium 1.13!'
