title: 'Mutual Authentication with Cilium'
ogSummary: 'Introduced in Cilium 1.14 is support for a much-requested feature: mutual authentication.
From its inception, we looked at delivering an optimal effortless user experience to achieve mutual authentication.
The result is simple: add 2 lines of YAML to your Cilium Network Policy, and that’s it – your workload communication is now secured with a mutual TLS handshake.
Try it in this new Star Wars-inspired lab!'
