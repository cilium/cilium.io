title: 'Getting started with eBPF'
ogSummary: 'eBPF is the new standard to program Linux kernel capabilities in a safe and efficient manner without requiring to change kernel source code or loading kernel modules. It has enabled a new generation of high performance tooling to be developed covering networking, security, and observability use cases.
The best way to learn about eBPF is to read the book “What is eBPF” by Liz Rice. And the best way to have your first experience with eBPF programming is to walk through this lab, which takes the opensnoop example out of the book and teaches you to handle an eBPF tool, watch it loading its components and even add your own tracing into the source eBPF code.'
