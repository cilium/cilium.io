title: 'Cilium LoadBalancer IPAM and BGP Service Advertisement'
ogSummary: 'BGP support was initially introduced in Cilium 1.10 and subsequent improvements have been made since, such as the recent introduction of IPv6 support in Cilium 1.12.
In Cilium 1.13, that support was enhanced with the introduction of Load Balancer IPAM and BGP Service address advertisements. In this lab, you will learn about both these new features and how they can simplify your network connectivity operations.'
