title: 'Advanced BGP Features'
ogSummary: 'BGP support was initially introduced in Cilium 1.10 and subsequent improvements have been made since, such as the recent introduction of IPv6 support in Cilium 1.12 and Service IP Advertisements in Cilium 1.13.
Improvements are continuing in Cilium 1.14 with the introduction of BGP timers, eBGP multihop and BGP Graceful restart!
In this lab, the user will learn about both these new features and how they can simplify their network connectivity operations.'
