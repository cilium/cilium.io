ogSummary: 'In this scenario, we are going to simulate the exploitation of a nodejs application, with the attacker spawning a reverse shell inside of a container and moving laterally within the Kubernetes environment.
We will demonstrate how the combined Process and Network Event Data:

tie the suspicious processes to a randomly generated External Domain Name
trace the Lateral Movement and Data Exfiltration of the attacker post-exploit'
