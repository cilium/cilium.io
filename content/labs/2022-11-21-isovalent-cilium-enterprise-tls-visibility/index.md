title: 'Isovalent Cilium Enterprise: TLS Visibility'
ogSummary: 'In this scenario, we are going to show how Isovalent Cilium Enterprise can provide visibility into TLS traffic.
In Security Audits, a company or team has to verify their application protects data in transit and doesnâ€™t leak information during communication, especially when data leaves a sensitive internal network. Mechanisms like TLS ensure that data is encrypted in transit, but verifying that a TLS configuration is secure becomes a challenge for most companies.
In this lab, you will learn how Isovalent Cilium Enterprise can 1) identify the version of TLS being used, informing us if an obsolete and insecure version is being used, 2) report on the cipher being used and 3) export events in JSON format to SIEM.'
