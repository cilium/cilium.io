  Welcome to Cilium's maintainer track session where you'll get an update on how Cilium is expanding the frontiers of cloud native networking, observability, and security. After graduating and becoming the de-facto standard CNI for Kubernetes, what comes next? We'll start with a brief overview of each part of the project before giving a update on Cilium Service Mesh's mutual authentication. Next, we'll dive into how Cilium is expanding beyond Kubernetes with load balancing and multi-cloud networking and into runtime enforcement with Tetragon. In this session, you'll hear from Cilium contributors and users Isovalent, Palantir, and white duck.

- Come and have a chat at the Cilium kiosk in the Project Pavilion throughout
  the event
