KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2024 is nearly here, and it's packed with activities centered around Cilium. As the standard for high-performance networking, observability, and security in the Cloud Native ecosystem, Cilium is set to be a major point of discussion throughout the event, especially following the recent release of [Cilium 1.15](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.15.0).

Starting with [Cilium + eBPF Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/cilium-ebpf-day/), the agenda features talks from end users like the New York Times, Roche, and Datadog, who will showcase the benefits they've achieved with the scalability, performance, and security capabilities of Cilium and eBPF. Cilium maintainers will also be diving into the architecture of the project and discussing where it is going next.

After Cilium + eBPF Day, there will be 11 other exciting talks about Cilium to catch when the main conference kicks off on Wednesday! The talks this year will cover high-scale networking, deep dives into security and observability with Tetragon, Hubble, and eBPF, and end-user stories from those implementing Cilium in highly regulated environments and on the edge. Similar to last year, there will be a Cilium booth in the Project Pavilion where you can meet the developers behind the project and have all your questions answered too.

Now, let's explore each of these talks in more detail.

## Cilium + eBPF Day

eBPF has unlocked new levels of performance and scalability for container networking. Cilium has leveraged eBPF to implement a plethora of network policy features. Kubernetes scalability has been improving with every new release, and clusters with 5k+ nodes are increasingly common. Cilium’s policy framework needs to scale for hundreds of thousands of pods while dealing with complex scenarios like high pod churn environments. In this talk, Cilium maintainers will share lessons learnt from years of programming Kubernetes abstractions directly into the kernel space using eBPF. You’ll learn about how cilium efficiently intercepts traffic for enforcement both at L4 and L7, tricks used by cilium to minimize CPU overhead on each node, and some design decisions that have been instrumental in squeezing high-performance out of the kernel regardless of the number of pods. Finally, we’ll discuss strategies you can follow to improve the debuggability of eBPF-based networking datapaths.

Like bees making honey, we developers forage the internet for code that we borrow and thread together to create software. It’s built, uploaded and shared, resulting in hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of software artefacts being built each day. For an unlucky few, attackers seek to infiltrate the build process like a hornet attacking a beehive. If they successfully attack a project with a large user base, the impact could be unprecedented, leading to the big bad ‘Game Over’ message rolling across the screen. In 2022, A Kubernetes-aware, Security Observability tool called Tetragon was released. This talk shows how the project serves as the key to the creation of a tool for securing build systems on Kubernetes. By leveraging Tetragon and eBPF, Attestagon aims to produce concise and cryptographically verifiable metadata. Come to this talk if you wish to see how any busy bee can inspect it to see whether a package was indeed sealed and delivered in the way the author intended.

[Speedrun Through Splicing Sockets with Sockmap - Jakub Sitnicki, Cloudflare](https://colocatedeventseu2024.sched.com/event/1YFjR/speedrun-through-splicing-sockets-with-sockmap-jakub-sitnicki-cloudflare?iframe=no)

Tuesday, March 19, 2024, 16:25 - 16:50 CET

Network proxies have one thing in common - they push data from one side to the other. If the proxy doesn't access the data, then we can delegate the task of moving it between sockets to the operating system. In Linux, applications that can move data in batches between sockets using the splice() syscall. However, this isn't the only method available! Linux network stack also offers an alternative API to transfer packets between sockets, called sockmap, which leverages the eBPF technology. In fact, your systems might be already using sockmap. This is what powers the transparent L7 filtering and socket-level policy enforcement in Cilium. In this talk, we will go over the fundamentals of sockmap API, its evolution and features, as well as its internal design. We'll also explore the existing caveats and limitations. By the end, you should have a clear understanding of what it takes to use the sockmap API or, if you are a Cilium user, what role sockmap plays in your existing K8S cluster.

[Dealing with eBPF’s Observability Data Deluge - Anna Kapuścińska, Isovalent](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeN5?iframe=no)

Wednesday, March 20, 2024, 15:25 - 16:00 CET

eBPF has created quite a buzz in observability because of its promise of no-instrumentation, low overhead, and complete observability. However, being able to observe and collect everything that is happening in a system can also create a deluge of data. Instead of sifting and winnowing to create a clear picture, eBPF can instead produce an even larger haystack to search through to find the critical observability needle. Drawing on practical production experience running observability systems for enterprises, this talk dives into strategies to deal with this torrent of data. It will go through examples from both the application monitoring and security observability arenas and demonstrate the commonalities between them and showcase real world benchmarking results. The audience will walk away with a better understanding of the pitfalls and perils of using eBPF for observability and how to overcome them.

[Simplifying Multi-Cluster and Multi-Cloud Deployments with Cilium - Liz Rice, Isovalent](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeQn/simplifying-multi-cluster-and-multi-cloud-deployments-with-cilium-liz-rice-isovalent?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no)

[Brewing the Kubernetes Storm Center: Open Source Threat Intelligence for the Cloud Native Ecosystem - Constanze Roedig, Technische Universität Wien & James Callaghan, ControlPlane](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeOX?iframe=no)

Thursday, March 21, 2024, 11:55 - 12:30 CET

The process of threat modelling can seem an abstract art, especially regarding scoring and prioritisation. We show how a non-expert can practically validate threat modelling predictions and quantify the relative risk of different attack vectors. After a general introduction, we propose an extensible method that, based on a given threat model: a) generates a Kubernetes-based environment with embedded trip-wires, enabling the detection of real attacker paths without interference, b) exposes these simulated environments to the wild to observe quantitative threat intelligence in action, and c) informs cost-effective decisions for a defensive team. We discuss caveats, emphasise the critical role of automation in scalability across diverse threat models, and live showcase one quantified attack tree utilising Tetragon. To benefit the Kubernetes ecosystem, this accessible framework can be crowd-sourced into an open source threat intelligence capturing network for risk exposure quantification.

[Running PCI-DSS Certified Kubernetes Workloads in the Public Cloud - Stephen Hoekstra, Schuberg Philis](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeQJ?iframe=no)

[No 'Soup' for You! Enforcing Network Policies for Host Processes via eBPF - Vinay Kulkarni, eBay](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeNT?iframe=no)

Friday, March 22, 2024, 11:00 - 11:35 CET

Current Kubernetes networking solutions provide basic security for pod network traffic using layers 3 and 4 CIDR-based or identity-based network policies. However, there is no mechanism to assign network identities to native processes running on hosts (e.g., kubelet) or processes in pods that use the host network. Securing host processes has traditionally been done using layer 7 auth, which comes with its overhead costs and scale challenges. In this talk, Vinay presents an innovative, industry-first approach that leverages eBPF to efficiently identify, in the kernel at the network layer, traffic from native host processes and pods using the host network. This takes network micro-segmentation to a new level. He will explain how host process identities are transmitted on a per-packet basis, and illustrate efficient network policy enforcement for such traffic. He will discuss how this approach offers significant scalability advantages, and conclude with a demo showcasing the proposed solution.

[At the Intersection of Cilium CNI and Service Mesh - Who Has the Right of Way?🚦 - Christine Kim, Isovalent](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeR5/at-the-intersection-of-cilium-cni-and-service-mesh-who-has-the-right-of-way-christine-kim-isovalent?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no)

Friday, March 22, 2024, 11:00 - 11:35 CET

Getting started with service mesh can be overwhelming. You might get nervous about how many tools you’ll have to keep up to date. With Cilium, you may have heard of it being a strong CNI (container network interface), but did you know you can have both a strong foundation and traffic management features? Let’s dispel some confusion and go through examples together on enabling Cilium to manage your cluster’s traffic.

[eBPF’s Abilities and Limitations: The Truth - Liz Rice & John Fastabend, Isovalent](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeQt?iframe=no)

Friday, March 22, 2024, 11:55 - 12:30 CET

eBPF is proving to be a great platform for cloud native infrastructure tooling, with several CNCF projects leveraging it to implement networking, security and observability capabilities from within the kernel. But as with any new technology, there are various myths and uncertainties circulating about it in the community, particularly around its limitations: you might hear that it’s not Turing complete, that it can’t be used for anything that involves state, or that it can’t be used to parse Layer 7 protocols. In this talk, we’ll disprove all these rumours with demonstrations including: - Looping in eBPF - Leveraging maps for the state - An eBPF implementation of a Turing machine equivalent This doesn’t mean eBPF is the right hammer for every nail; using the Cilium project as an example we’ll discuss why not every feature is implemented in the kernel. (Yet?)

[Cilium ClusterMesh in Action: Strengthening Security Across Distributed Kubernetes Clusters - Matheus Morais, Sicredi](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeRT/cilium-clustermesh-in-action-strengthening-security-across-distributed-kubernetes-clusters-matheus-morais-sicredi?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no)

Friday, March 22, 2024, 14:00 - 14:35 CET

Sicredi has over 2K applications running on 47 different K8s clusters deployed across a private cloud, built on Canonical OpenStack and public clouds. Such a complex environment needs a uniform framework to create a consistent security policy. Sicredi chose Service Mesh as such a mechanism, evaluated multiple competitors and selected Cilium ClusterMesh. This presentation will describe the evaluation process. Compare features of various service meshes and show how Sicredi used Cilium ClusterMesh to implement a full security policy across its infrastructure. Cilium is used as the CNI in Sicredi K8s clusters. Selecting it reduced operational and maintenance complexity. Cilium uses eBPF and avoids sidecars so has the best performance vs competing service meshes. Its fine-grain Cilium Network Policy made it possible to create rules access and operations rules per target application. Sicredi is Brazil’s largest credit union financial institution with over 7 million members.

[Comparing Sidecar-Less Service Mesh from Cilium and Istio - Christian Posta, Solo.io](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeRx/comparing-sidecar-less-service-mesh-from-cilium-and-istio-christian-posta-soloio?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no)

Friday, March 22, 2024, 14:55 - 15:30 CET

Service mesh is a powerful pattern for implementing strong zero-trust networking practices, introducing better network observability, and allowing for more fine-grained traffic control. Up until now, the sidecar pattern was used to implement service-mesh capability but as the technology matures, a new pattern has emerged: sidecarless service mesh. Two prominent open-source networking projects, Cilium and Istio, have implemented a sidecar-free approach to service mesh but they both make interesting design decisions and tradeoffs. In this talk we review the architecture of both, focusing on the pros and cons of implementations such as mutual authentication, ingress, and observability.
