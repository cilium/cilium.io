ogSummary: 'Weekly eBPF newsletter covering Linux 4.12-rc3 release, MIPS eBPF JIT implementation, ARM 32-bit JIT v2, stack depth tracking for BPF-to-BPF function calls, BPF ID system introduction, and hardware offload improvements. Essential updates for kernel developers.'
---

This is issue 05 of the regular newsletter around BPF written by Alexander Alemayhu. It summarizes ongoing development, presentations, videos and other information related to BPF and XDP. It is released roughly once a week.

Linux 4.12-rc3 was released last week. One usual `[GIT] Networking` pull request with some BPF fixes made it in. You can read all the highlights in [26th May](http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1406659.html). Also the [release email](http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1407286.html) briefly mentions BPF

> Anyway, rc3 has a little bit of everything. The biggest single change is actually just a documentation update (the intel pstate docs were converted to rst format), so the diffstat actually looks a bit odd with a wuarter just being documentation. There's also some tooling updates (perf and some bpf selftest).

More interesting highlights

- ARM 32-bit eBPF JIT saw a v2.
- MIPS eBPF JIT is in the works.
- The stack depth tracking, one step closer BPF to BPF functions.

## Videos

### [Open-NFP - Transparent eBPF Offload: Playing Nice with the Linux Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2v7zgUGp8A)

Introductory webinar on eBPF and XDP. It's mostly basic, so great talk for someone new to eBPF.

## In case you missed it

### [Further Reading](http://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/bpf/#further-reading)

The Cilium BPF and XDP reference guide has a growing collection of links to BPF content all around the web.
