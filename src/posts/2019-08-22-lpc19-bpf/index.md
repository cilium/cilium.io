The [Linux Plumbers Conference 2019](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4) is
coming up September 9-11 in Lisbon, Portugal. There are several tracks
featuring eBPF related topics:

- [BPF Microconference](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/sessions/62/#20190911)
- [Linux Networking Summit](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/sessions/41/#all)
- [Tracing Microconference](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/sessions/49/#20190911)

## BPF Microconference

The microconference is hosted by the two eBPF upstream maintainers Alexei
Starovoitov and Daniel Borkmann.

> The goal of the BPF Microconference is to bring BPF developers together to discuss and hash out unresolved issues and to move new ideas forward. The focus of this year's event is on the core BPF infrastructure as well as its many subsystems and related user space tooling.

> The BPF Microconference will be open to all LPC attendees. There is no additional registration required. This is also a great occasion for BPF users and developers to meet face to face and to exchange and discuss developments.

As usual, presentation material will be made available after the event.
