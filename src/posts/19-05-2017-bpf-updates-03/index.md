This is issue 03 of the regular newsletter around BPF written by Alexander Alemayhu. It summarizes ongoing development, presentations, videos and other information related to BPF and XDP. It is released roughly once a week.

The Linux kernel merge window closed up last week and v4.12-rc1 was released. One usual `[GIT] Networking` pull request was sent before the rc and one the day after. The are some BPF related fixes, see dates for all the highlights

- [9th May](https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg434497.html)
- [15th May](https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg435111.html)

## In case you missed it

A lot of good content showed up this week. Check them all out below

### [bpf.h and you...](https://www.spinics.net/lists/xdp-newbies/msg00179.html)

Great walk-through on writing a eBPF program. Starts from the header includes to the main bits.

### [eBPF, part 2: Syscall and Map Types](https://ferrisellis.com/posts/ebpf_syscall_and_maps/)

Overview of `bpf(2)` with sections on the commands and map types. Also nice to see links to the various upstream commits.

### [Monitoring the Control Plane](http://firstclassfunc.com/2017/05/monitoring-the-control-plane/)

Interesting read on capturing routing information with BPF.

### [Contextually speaking...](https://www.spinics.net/lists/xdp-newbies/msg00181.html)

Provides descriptions on the BPF program types and walkthrough some of them with a example at the end.

### [Elf Hello World Tutorial](http://www.cirosantilli.com/elf-hello-world/)

Useful for understanding how loaders (iproute2, etc) parse BPF ELF file.

### [XDP Newbies...](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg162375.html)

> Which is a place where people can talk about getting up to speed with setting up an XDP build environment and writing XDP programs.

You can subscribe by sending a email to `majordomo@vger.kernel.org`, with a message body containing `subscribe xdp-newbies`. No subject is needed, but you can of course add one if you like.

> Debugging #eBPF: there is now an IDA processor available on GitHub.
