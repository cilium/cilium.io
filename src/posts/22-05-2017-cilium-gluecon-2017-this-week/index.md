The Cilium team is excited to be at [GlueCon 2017](http://gluecon.com/) Wed + Thurs this week, just outside Denver, CO.   GlueCon is a great developer-focused conference focused on APIs, containers, microservices, serverless, etc. We've enjoyed attending as individuals in the past, and are excited to be sponsoring this year!

We will be presenting "Cilium + BPF: Least Privilege Security on API Call Level for Microservices" on **Wed from 2:50-3:20pm** .  **This talk is on Track 1**\.   Come on by!

And all conference we'll be available at our Cilium booth to answer questions about API-aware network security, give demos, and of course, give away our Cilium t-shirts.  See you there!
