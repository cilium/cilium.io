###### July 01st, 2025

##### Author: Donia Chaiehloudj, Isovalent@Cisco

eCHO (‚ÄúeBPF & Cilium Office Hours‚Äù) is our weekly live-stream where maintainers, users, and special guests pull back the
curtain on all things Cilium, eBPF, Hubble, and Tetragon. Since episode #1 we‚Äôve:

- Shipped 180 + sessions ranging from five-minute demos to full architecture deep-dives
- Answered live YouTube questions in real time
- Captured every recording so you can binge-watch at your own pace.

To make the library easier to navigate we‚Äôve created theme-based playlist - think of them as fast-track learning paths.
Pick a topic, hit play, and work through the sessions in any order that fits your day. In total you‚Äôll find 16 playlists,
grouped into six themes that mirror the Cilium journey: Cilium in Production (installs and upgrades), Networking for Kubernetes
(policies and datapath), Runtime Security (Tetragon), Mesh Networking (service and cluster mesh), Gateway-API & Traffic Management,
All Things eBPF (development and observability), and Ecosystem & Community (releases, conferences, culture).

# üöÄ Cilium in Production

Running Cilium in a home lab is fun, but running it in anger across EKS, bare-metal, and on-prem clusters requires repeatable workflows and a few battle-tested tricks. The Cilium in Production playlist condenses those lessons into one place.

### What you‚Äôll learn

- Choosing (and changing) data-plane modes on managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE).
- Safe blue/green upgrades with Helm and Pulumi.
- Debugging the odd corner cases on OpenShift, vSphere, or air-gapped bare metal.
- Real-world migration stories from Calico, Flannel, and others.

# üåê Networking for Kubernetes

Kubernetes ships with an ‚Äúallow-all‚Äù networking and leaves the policy enforcement and performance tuning to your CNI.
The Networking for Kubernetes playlist tackles everything from writing first NetworkPolicy to packet-level performance tuning.

#### What you‚Äôll learn

- Writing a default-deny policy and graduating to L7 HTTP and DNS rules.
- Following a single packet through XDP, tc, and the eBPF conntracker (‚ÄúLife of a Packet‚Äù).
- Benchmarking NodePort vs Maglev vs BGP mode and knowing when to switch.
- Pros and cons of popular CNIs and why teams migrate to Cilium.

# üîÄ Mesh Networking

From in-cluster L7 routing to cross-cluster fail-over, Cilium delivers mesh traffic without sidecars or iptables overhead.
The two playlists below cover both layers: one for the Service Mesh inside a cluster,
and one for Cluster Mesh that stretches services across clusters.

#### What you‚Äôll learn

- Stretching services across clusters with ClusterMesh fail-over.
- Integrating Envoy, and Gateway API without iptables overhead.

# üîí Runtime Security with Tetragon

Need process-level enforcement and instant CVE detection? The Tetragon playlist shows how eBPF can hook every `execve`,
file write, and socket call before turning them into actionable policies.

#### What you‚Äôll learn

- Building allow/deny rules at PID and binary granularity.
- Detecting supply-chain attacks (e.g. XZ Utils CVE) in real time.
- Capturing least-privilege baselines for production workloads.

# üêù All Things eBPF

Whether you‚Äôre writing custom programs or just want better observability, these playlists cover the kernel side of life.

#### What you‚Äôll learn

- eBPF architecture, verifier workflow, and key helper functions.
- Building custom programs and loaders with libbpf.
- End-to-end observability with BPFTrace, Hubble, and continuous profiling.
- Real-world use cases beyond containers like live VM migration by Loophole labs.
