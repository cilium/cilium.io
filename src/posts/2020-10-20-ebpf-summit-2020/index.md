ogSummary: "The first ever eBPF Summit is just over one week out and we are already well
past 1'000 registrations. We have been blown away by the number of talk and
keynote proposals. This also meant that we had to turn down many fantastic
talks and we hope that our selection provides an interesting and diverse set of
talks. Some of the content that did not make the schedule will be posted as
blog posts on ebpf.io over the coming weeks. In this post, we'll give a quick
preview of what to be excited about and how to plan to attend the event.

# What is eBPF Summit?

eBPF is quickly becoming one of the most talked about technologies in our
industry - enabling a new generation of networking, tracing, observability and
security infrastructure. The eBPF Summit is targeted at users and potential
users of this groundbreaking technology - both those looking at leveraging eBPF
directly or via one of the projects leveraging eBPF (e.g. bpftrace, Cilium,
Falco, etc.)

The summit will be held Oct 28-29, 2020 in a fully virtual setting and will
feature a mix of voices from the various eBPF communities. We'll hear from the
eBPF maintainers, various eBPF-based projects, eBPF book authors but most
importantly, we'll hear from a wide set of eBPF users sharing their experience
on how they leverage and utilize eBPF.

# Keynotes

On both days, we will feature a set of 15 min keynotes from interesting people
in the eBPF space. We'll hear from both eBPF Co-Maintainers, eBPF-based project
maintainers, book authors, and otherwise awesome people.

## Lightning Talks

We have received numerous submissions for the lightning talk sessions which
will be spread over both days as well. The quality of the submissions has been
overwhelming. We have explicitly chosen to only run lightning sessions to give
a voice to as many members in the community as possible. Despite this, we have
received more than 3 times as many submissions as available speaking slots so
we had to turn down many awesome talks. We will definitely repeat this event
and will consider expanding the scope of it to provide more speaking
opportunities.

The schedule for the lightning talks is still being finalized, as it stands
right now, the following talks will be presented during the lightning talk
session. We will announce the exact speaking times as we receive all title,
abstract and session information from all the speakers.

## Conclusion

I'm personally extremely thrilled about the summit and look forward to it with
excitement. In particular about the diversity of voices that we will hear from.
eBPF is quickly turning into one of the most important technologies and the
broad community pushing it forward is one of the most important factors of
eBPF's success.
