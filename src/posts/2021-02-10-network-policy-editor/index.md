Implementing Network Policy is a critical part of building a secure Kubernetes-based platform, but the learning curve from simple examples to more complex real-world policies is steep. Not only can it be painful to get the YAML syntax and formatting just right, but more importantly, there are many subtleties in the behavior of the network policy specification (e.g. default allow/deny, namespacing, wildcarding, rules combination, etc.). Even an experienced Kubernetes YAML-wrangler can still easily tie their brain in knots working through an advanced network policy use case.

Over the past years, we have learned a lot about the common challenges while working with many of you in the Cilium community implementing Kubernetes Network Policy. Today, we are excited to announce a new free tool for the community to assist you in your journey with Kubernetes NetworkPolicy: <a href="https://editor.cilium.io" target="_blank">editor.cilium.io</a>:

## How exactly does editor.cilium.io help?

To make this more concrete, let‚Äôs explore five common gotchas we see trip up those working with Network Policy, both newbies and sometimes (gulp!) those of us who have been doing this for a while. At the end of each mistake, you‚Äôll find a link to a short (3-5 minute) tutorial in the tool that walks you through each step required to fix the mistake.

### Mistake 1: Not Using a Namespace Selector

Consider a scenario where we want a centralized Prometheus instance running in a `monitoring` namespace to be able to scrape metrics from a Redis Pod running in the `default` namespace. Take a look at the following network policy, which is applied in the `default` namespace. It allows Pods with label `app=prometheus` to scrape metrics from Pods with label `app=redis`:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px', marginTop: "-20px" }}>
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-ingress-from-prometheus
    namespace: default
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: redis
    policyTypes:
      - Ingress
    ingress:
      - from:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: prometheus
  ```
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px' }}>
    ![](mistake-1.png)
  </div>
</div>

As you can see in the editor's visualization, the above network policy will only work if both Pods are in the same namespace. The `podSelector` is scoped to the policy's namespace unless you explicitly use `namespaceSelector` to select other namespaces.

How do you do this right?

### Mistake 2: "There is no way it‚Äôs DNS..."

It is common that workloads must be locked down to limit external access (i.e. ‚Äúegress‚Äù default deny). If you want to prevent your application from sending traffic anywhere except to Pods in the same namespace, you might create the following policy:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px', marginTop: "-20px" }}>
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-kube-dns
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: foo
  egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector: {}
```
</div>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px' }}>
    ![](mistake-2.png)
  </div>
</div>

However, once you deploy this network policy, your application connectivity will likely be broken.

Why?

> It‚Äôs not DNS<br/>
> There is no way it‚Äôs DNS<br/>
> It was DNS

Pods will typically reach other Kubernetes services via their DNS name (e.g., service1.tenant-a.svc.cluster.local), and resolving this name requires the Pod to send egress traffic to Pods with labels `k8s-app=kube-dns` in the `kube-system` namespace.

So how do you solve this?

### Mistake 3: Using Traditional Networking Constructs

If you come from a traditional Networking background, it might be tempting to use a /32 CIDR rule to allow traffic to the IP address of a Pod as shown in the output of `kubectl describe pod`. For example:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px', marginTop: "-20px" }}>
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-egress-to-pod
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: foo
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.2.125/32
```
</div>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px' }}>
    ![](mistake-3.png)
  </div>
</div>

However, Pod IPs are ephemeral and unpredictable, and depending on a network plugin implementation, ipBlock rules might only allow egress traffic to destinations outside of the cluster. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#behavior-of-to-and-from-selectors" target="_block">Kubernetes documentation</a> recommends using ipBlocks only for IP addresses outside of your cluster. So how do you solve this?

### Mistake 4: Misunderstanding How Policy Rules Combine

Let's take a look at another egress policy example, that seeks to allow Pods with label `app=foo` to establish egress connections to an external VM with IP `192.168.1.22` on port `443`.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px', marginTop: "-20px"  }}>
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: egress-to-private-vm-443
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: foo
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 192.168.1.22/32
    - ports:
        - port: 443
```
</div>
  <div style={{ flex: '3', minWidth: '300px' }}>
    ![](mistake-4.png)
  </div>  
</div>

Wait... while this is valid YAML and a valid network policy, one extra character in the YAML made a huge difference here, and ended up allowing a lot more connectivity than expected. The additional ‚Äú-‚Äù in front of ‚Äúports‚Äù meant that this is interpreted as two different rules, one that allows all traffic to the VM IP (on any port) and another that allows all traffic to port 443 (regardless of the destination IP address). The network policy specification dictates that the rules are logically OR'ed (not AND'ed), meaning the Pod workload has significantly more connectivity than intended.

How do you prevent these mistakes?

### Mistake 5: Confusing Different Uses for ‚Äú{}‚Äù

In Network Policy, empty curly braces (i.e., ‚Äú{}‚Äù) can have a different meaning in different contexts, leading to a lot of confusion. We‚Äôll use this last example as a quiz. What is the difference between these two similar looking network policy rules that both leverage ‚Äú{}‚Äù? Take a guess, then look at each rule in the Network Policy Editor below to see if you were right.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px' }}>
    ```yaml
    ingress:
      - {}
    ```
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: '2', minWidth: '300px' }}>
    ```yaml
    ingress:
      - from:
          - podSelector: {}
    ```
  </div>
</div>
