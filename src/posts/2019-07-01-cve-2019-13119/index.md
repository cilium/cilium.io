On May 25 2019, a security relevant bug has been reported to us via the
documented [security disclosure channel](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
Thanks to _l14n_ for the excellent bug report! It was soon identified that
multiple vendors are affected by this vulnerability. This lead to an embargo
period which is being lifted today.

The bug allows, under certain circumstances, to bypass network security
policies. See below for details on the vulnerability and the mitigation.

**Who is affected?:**
Users operating Cilium in encapsulation mode (VXLAN or Geneve) while hosting
untrusted workloads with an egress policy that allows pods to emit UDP
encapsulation traffic to other worker nodes.

The vulnerability is being tracked by [CVE-2019-13119](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13119)

We are releasing Cilium 1.5.4, 1.4.5, and 1.3.7 to fix the security vulnerability.

# Vulnerability details

An endpoint can emit encapsulation traffic to another node running Cilium and
given certain conditions are met, that node will accept the encapsulated
traffic and route it. This can bypass egress security policies. If the endpoint
is able to guess security identities correctly, the endpoint can also
impersonate other security identities.

Conditions that must be met:

- Cilium must be running in encapsulation mode. This is the default
  configuration mode.

- The egress policy of the endpoint must allow UDP on the configured
  encapsulation port. This port is different depending on whether VXLAN
  or Geneve is being used as the encapuslation protocol. Alternatively, if the
  endpoint has access to an external LB such as a NodePort which redirects to
  the configured UDP encapsulation port on any node, the policy must allow for
  this. Redirection to a UDP encapsulation port using a CluserIP or headless
  service is not affected as the load-balancing decision happens before egress
  policy.

- The endpoint must be aware of at least one node IP or be aware of an
  external LB that redirects to a node IP.

- Masquerading of egress traffic to worker node IP must be enabled,
  if masquerading is disabled, the remote tunnel will reject the traffic. This
  means that known or guessed worker node IP must be a node IP which is
  considered outside of the cluster so masquerading is performed.

- The endpoint must guess a Cilium security identity or be aware of well-known
  security identities which is allowed by the ingress policy of the destination
  service. Even if no ingress policy is used, the guessed security identity
  must be valid, i.e. it must be a well-known security identity or an security
  identity that is actively in-use by a pod.

  In the reported attack scenario, the reporter has used `tcpdump` on one of
  the nodes to derive the security identity by inspecting the wire and
  replaying encapsulation traffic. Cilium provides support for node level
  encryption. The attack assumes that no encryption is performed. However, the
  security identity is a construct intended for scale. The 32 bit numeric space
  used to group workloads with identical security identity together can be
  subject to brute-force attacks.

# Mitigation

In order to mitigate this, the following fix is applied:

Any UDP traffic emitted by an endpoint to one of the supported encapsulation
ports is now dropped with a distinct drop reason:

```
xx drop (Encapsulation traffic is prohibited) flow 0xcab0685a to endpoint 0, identity 3087->2: 10.16.209.20:39258 -> 192.168.122.124:8472 udp
```

As Cilium performs load-balancing (enabled by default) before the egress
policy enforcement is applied, any traffic subject to a Kubernetes ClusterIP
service that load-balances to an encapsulation port is also rejected. This
is _not_ the case if you are using kube-proxy as the load-balancing happens
after the standard egress policy enforcement point.

# Questions

Thanks again to _l14n_ for disclosing the vulnerability to us via the private
security mailing list so we could provide a bugfix relese before disclusing the
details publicly. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us on
[Slack](https://cilium.io/slack).
