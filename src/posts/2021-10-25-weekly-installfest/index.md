## Weekly Cilium Introduction with Live Q&A

![](live_qa.png)

The weekly Cilium Introduction hosted by Cilium Co-Creator Thomas Graf is an
ideal venue to learn about Cilium if you have never heard about it, or if you
already know about Cilium but have questions that you want to get answers to
by one of the Cilium maintainers.

The Cilium Introduction will answer questions such as:

- What is Cilium? What is eBPF?
- Why did we create Cilium?
- What are the key Cilium use cases?
- Why are Google, AWS, Alibaba and other cloud providers using Cilium?
- Cilium AMA: Ask any question you have about Cilium.

The weekly Cilium introduction is available to everyone in the community.
