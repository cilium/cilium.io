[Scaling Network Policy Enforcement Beyond the Cluster Boundary with Cilium - Hemanth Malla & Maxime Visonneau, Datadog](https://colocatedeventsna2024.sched.com/event/1izs0/scaling-network-policy-enforcement-beyond-the-cluster-boundary-with-cilium-hemanth-malla-maxime-visonneau-datadog)

Tuesday, November 12, 2024, 1:30 pm - 1:55 pm MST

To keep up with infrastructure growth, companies around the world are managing an increasing number of Kubernetes clusters. Enforcing Kubernetes native network policy at scale is already hard enough within a single cluster. Extending this to multiple clusters is even more challenging. Depending on the shape of your infrastructure, your cross-cluster policy requirements may be unique, and there’s no one-size-fits-all configuration. In this talk, we’ll dive deep into how different solutions work in cilium to understand sources of potential bottlenecks. We’ll discuss Clustermesh, KVstoremesh, DNS-based FQDN policy, and a custom variant of KVstoremesh Datadog leverages while meshing at scale. Specifically, we’ll discuss how factors like the number of pods, identities, and pod churn will impact scalability and time to policy enforcement. Join us if you’re curious about understanding the latest in cross-cluster policy and leave with actionable insights you can apply to your infrastructure.

[How to Use XDP and eBPF to Accelerate IPSec Throughput by 400% - Ryan Drew, Isovalent, now part of Cisco](https://colocatedeventsna2024.sched.com/event/1izsR/how-to-use-xdp-and-ebpf-to-accelerate-ipsec-throughput-by-400-ryan-drew-isovalent-now-part-of-cisco)

Tuesday, November 12, 2024, 2:05 pm - 2:30 pm MST

The techniques used to increase IPSec network performance are often kept as secrets because they act as a competitive advantage and a lucrative product offering. This talk transparently presents a technique for massively boosting IPSec performance that is simple to implement (less than 200 lines of C), and based entirely on open-source work. An early Proof of Concept (POC) implementation showed an increase in p99 throughput by 412%! This talk will take a deep dive into how it all works, covering: the implementation, the pros and cons of the design, and an analysis of benchmark results. As transparent encryption becomes more crucial for securing data in transit, we hope this talk will enable users required to use IPSec for compliance or infrastructure reasons to learn how to speed up their network without having to compromise their security.

[Live Migrating Production Clusters From Calico to Cilium - Moh Ahmed & Raymond Maika, SamsungAds](https://colocatedeventsna2024.sched.com/event/1mFPd/live-migrating-production-clusters-from-calico-to-cilium-moh-ahmed-raymond-maika-samsungads)

Tuesday, November 12, 2024, 2:40 pm - 3:05 pm MST

Engineers may be tasked with rolling out a new Container Networking Interface (CNI) to their environment. Sounds easy enough! Delete the old one, and deploy the new one. Or maybe just deploy a brand new cluster! What if... there was another way? The talk will show how a live, in-place migration of the CNI plugin was performed in production clusters. It will highlight a few approaches that were considered, and what approach was eventually selected before proceeding with the migration process. Lastly, the procedure and steps taken to execute this migration will be shared, along with any lessons learned.

[Hubble Beyond Cilium - Anubhab Majumdar & Mathew Merrick, Microsoft](https://colocatedeventsna2024.sched.com/event/1iztI/hubble-beyond-cilium-anubhab-majumdar-mathew-merrick-microsoft)

Tuesday, November 12, 2024, 3:20 pm - 3:45 pm MST

Hubble is a great solution for finding and fixing network problems in a Kubernetes cluster. However, we noticed that one of the main barriers for people to use Hubble is its dependency on Cilium as the dataplane. In this talk, we'll demonstrate how to decouple Hubble from Cilium, and use Hubble as a powerful Observability/metrics platform on top of any custom data plane. We will show you how to make Hubble work with any data source you want, without changing any code in Hubble. We'll show you an example of one such open source project called Retina and compare how key features work with both Cilium and custom CNI. In a live demo, we will show that you can get the same experience with Hubble regardless of what CNI you use.

[Lessons Learned Migrating to Modern Multi-Platform eBPF Programs - Dave Tucker, Red Hat](https://colocatedeventsna2024.sched.com/event/1izth/lessons-learned-migrating-to-modern-multi-platform-ebpf-programs-dave-tucker-red-hat)

Tuesday, November 12, 2024, 3:55 pm - 4:20 pm MST

Kepler needed to migrate its old eBPF probes developed with BCC to probes that were compiled ahead of time. Maybe you do too? While performing this migration we were able to use some modern features of eBPF, the cilium/ebpf Go library, and bpf2go to make our probes multi-platform. Kepler (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter) is a CNCF project focused on measuring the environmental impact of software. At its core, Kepler uses eBPF to gather metrics from the Linux Kernel, which feeds into an ML model that estimates power consumption for processes, VMs, and Pods. By the end of this session, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of eBPF, practical insights into its application in power consumption monitoring, and strategies for modernizing existing eBPF programs. Join us to learn from our experience and take away actionable best practices for your projects!

[⚡ Lightning Talk: Applying Cilium at Edge with KubeEdge - Tomoya Fujita, Sony Corporation of America](https://colocatedeventsna2024.sched.com/event/1izuu/cl-lightning-talk-applying-cilium-at-edge-with-kubeedge-tomoya-fujita-sony-corporation-of-america)

Tuesday, November 12, 2024, 5:15 pm - 5:25 pm MST

Applications in edge environments can be platform-dependent, complicated, and distributed in regions, and the number of devices significantly increases. Our final goal is to create the infrastructure that can be applied to the entire environment crossing over the cloud and edge in common. Working with KubeEdge and Cilium, we are now successfully able to use Cilium with KubeEdge-hosted nodes at edge environment. This means, that enabling wireguard VPN with Cilium can provide transparent network connectivity with the nodes running in the cloud infrastructure so that edge nodes running at edge environment just appear to be a member of the cluster system but with edge autonomy feature provided by KubeEdge. We would like to share our technical insights and experience with using Cilium at Edge with KubeEdge, and what are the future development and contribution to the Cilium community.

Wednesday, November 13, 2024, 2:30 pm - 3:05 pm MST

To increase data security for cloud and hybrid cloud deployments, many companies, governments, standards, and tenders require data in transit to be protected. However, network encryption comes at a cost - what is the performance impact and how can we reduce it? In this session, we explore how network encryption can be efficiently enforced with Cilium, eBPF, and WireGuard. We dive deep into Cilium’s integration of WireGuard and elaborate on both the management plane and Cilium’s eBPF datapath. We analyze and benchmark what performance cost one can expect and explore opportunities in the Linux kernel to reduce that price. This talk is for operators and security teams that need to encrypt network traffic, but also want to minimize its overhead. The audience will walk away understanding whether network encryption needs to come at a high toll and whether there are opportunities for optimizations.

[From Observability to Enforcement: Lessons Learned Implementing eBPF Runtime Security - Anna Kapuścińska & Kornilios Kourtis, Isovalent](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1i7ma/from-observability-to-enforcement-lessons-learned-implementing-ebpf-runtime-security-anna-kapuscinska-kornilios-kourtis-isovalent)

Wednesday, November 13, 2024, 5:25 pm - 6:00 pm MST

eBPF is getting widely adopted in cloud native runtime security tools like Falco, KubeArmor, and Tetragon. Using eBPF we can collect relevant security events right in the kernel and pass them to Security Engineers for retroactive attack detection and response. Having reliable and complete visibility is great, but wouldn't it be even better to proactively prevent attacks in progress? This talk covers the Tetragon team’s experience moving from security observability to enforcement and lessons learned along the way: from defining security models to hardening interactions between the local kernel and distributed Kubernetes systems. It will deep dive into how eBPF-based enforcement works, why it differs from observability, and the challenges of implementing it. The audience will walk away understanding the inner workings and common pitfalls of eBPF-based runtime security.

[Seeing Double? Implementing Multicast with eBPF and Cilium - Louis DeLosSantos, Isovalent at Cisco](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1i7qG/seeing-double-implementing-multicast-with-ebpf-and-cilium-louis-delossantos-isovalent-at-cisco)

Friday, November 15, 2024, 11:55 am - 12:30 pm MST

Multicast is a popular networking technology used in finance, telecommunications, and media CDNs, among others to efficiently replicate and deliver data streams to multiple clients. However, this advantage can be overshadowed by the complexity involved in configuring the necessary infrastructure leaving the overworked platform team rather than the end users seeing double. To combat this complexity, Cilium explored using eBPF to implement pod-to-pod multicast delivery within a Kubernetes cluster. This talk will provide both a high and low-level understanding of how eBPF can be used to implement multicast delivery. It will discuss how Cilium’s multicast works and the hurdles faced by the project along the way. By the end of this talk, the audience will have a better understanding of how multicast functions, how eBPF can be used in place of traditional multicast infrastructure, and how Cilium can be used as a multicast-enabled CNI, letting your audience - and not you- see double.

[Seccomp and eBPF; What’s the Difference? Why Do I Need to Know? - Natalia Reka Ivanko & Duffie Cooley, Isovalent @ Cisco](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1i7qb)

Friday, November 15, 2024, 2:00 pm - 2:35 pm MST

Containers in Kubernetes share a common Linux kernel so how can we limit access where it isn’t required so we can follow the principle of least privilege? Join Natalia and Duffie as they each explore different approaches to harden your container security with Secure Computing (seccomp) and eBPF! The talk will begin with an overview and comparison between seccomp and eBPF and how they both can solve the same problem - limiting access to the Linux Kernel that all containers share. This will be a fun talk, showing each solution with a live demo. You will leave this talk with a better understanding of how to limit what system calls a process can make and restrict your containers’ behavior to only access the files, binaries and external DNS names they need and nothing more. Which is the right solution for your environment? Come and learn about two of the commonly used technologies in use today!

[The Key Value of Etcd Over Custom Resources: Scalability - Jef Spaleta, Isovalent at Cisco](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/#)

Friday, November 15, 2024 2:55 pm - 3:30 pm MST

Cilium defaults to using Kubernetes Custom Resources to hold Cilium specific internal state, however when the cluster is large enough, the Kubernetes API becomes a bottleneck on performance. To scale a cluster to hundreds of nodes, Cilium can be configured to use a dedicated external etcd instance. This talk will discuss the details of what the external etcd looks like from an operator perspective, and explore why Cilium uses an external etcd for enhanced scalability. It will cover how to manage a cluster by bypassing the Kubernetes API and interacting only with the cluster's etcd key-value store - and also why it might be a bad idea. Get a taste of what's possible by bypassing the Kubernetes API and interacting with the etcd API directly, and learn why Cilium has an option to use a dedicated etcd deployment, not shared by the Kubernetes API, for holding Cilium state and the scalability benefits it can bring to your cluster.
