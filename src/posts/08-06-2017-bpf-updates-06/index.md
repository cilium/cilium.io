ogSummary: 'BPF and XDP development updates: BPF ID patches merged, perf events support added, XDP tutorials released, and verifier improvements for Linux kernel networking.'
---

This is issue 06 of the regular newsletter around BPF written by Alexander Alemayhu. It summarizes ongoing development, presentations, videos and other information related to BPF and XDP. It is released roughly once a week.

---

Linux 4.12-rc4 was released this week. No new BPF changes were in this release, but several patches were applied on netdev. The highlights are

- The BPF id patches which were ready last week but had to be re-spin because of merge conflicts.
- All perf events now have BPF support.

Other interesting topics

- VF XDP support for the qede driver.
- Better alignment tracking and improvements to the verifier.

See the patches section for all the links.

## Videos

### [Netdev 2.1 - XDP for the Rest of Us By Andy Gospodarek + Jesper Dangaard Brouer](https://youtu.be/iBkR4gvjxtE)

Extensive walk-through of the XDP programs in the [prototype-kernel](https://github.com/netoptimizer/prototype-kernel) repository. The talk is overall great and covers several BPF and XDP concepts from the programmer perspective. Also nice to hear tips, tricks and pitfalls being covered.

## In case you missed it

### [Cilium v0.9 Released: Hello Kubernetes!](https://www.cilium.io/blog/2017/5/31/cilium-v09-released-hello-kubernetes)

Cilium 0.9.0 was released last week.

### [XDP Newbies...](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg162375.html)

> Which is a place where people can talk about getting up to speed with setting up an XDP build environment and writing XDP programs.

You can subscribe by sending a email to `majordomo@vger.kernel.org`, with a message body containing `subscribe xdp-newbies`. No subject is needed, but you can of course add one if you like.
