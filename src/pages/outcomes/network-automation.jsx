  heading: 'Make your networking configuration as dynamic as your workloads',
  paragraphs: [
    'As workloads in cloud native environments scale, shift, and redeploy across clusters and clouds, manual network configuration quickly becomes unsustainable. Engineers are left to manage rigid IP rules, duplicate policies across environments, and react to changes rather than design systems that adapt automatically.',
    'Cilium addresses this by making the network programmable and declarative. It allows teams to specify intent once, using workload identity and Kubernetes-native components, and then trust that connectivity, security, and observability will respond in real time as the environment changes. This means less time spent developing and debugging YAML, fewer outages due to misconfigured rules, and increased confidence when deploying infrastructure or adding new services.',
    'By removing manual steps from the networking stack, Cilium helps platform and security teams move faster, reduce risk, and operate more reliably in even the most dynamic environments.',

const sectionContent2 = {
  heading: 'Enforcing identity-driven policies instead of IP-based rules',
  paragraphs: [
    'As workloads scale, restart, or move across nodes and clusters, IP addresses change constantly, creating configuration gaps, or a need for continual manual updates.',
    'Cilium solves this by applying security policies tied to Kubernetes-native identities like service accounts, pod labels, and namespaces. These identities remain consistent even as workloads shift, so policies follow services automatically without requiring engineers to rewrite or reapply static rules. This keeps network behavior predictable, secure, and in sync with your infrastructure design, with little to no manual intervention.',
