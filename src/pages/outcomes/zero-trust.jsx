    'Traditional network security measures can be ineffective in cloud native systems due to the transient nature of IP addresses, the dynamic nature of workloads, and the rapid growth of east-west traffic. These internal communication routes are undefended by standard firewall-based security, and it becomes next to impossible to maintain static IP rules or network segments across numerous environments.',
    'Zero Trust Networking directly addresses these challenges by shifting the focus from trusting the network to explicitly verifying each connection and workload. Instead of assuming anything inside the network is safe, Zero Trust Networking requires all communication to be authenticated and authorized based on what a workload is, not where it runs. Cilium makes this practical in cloud native environments by enforcing identity-aware policies tied to Kubernetes service accounts and labels, applying them efficiently in the kernel with eBPF, supporting multi-cluster and multi-cloud deployments, and providing deep visibility into and security for service-to-service communication.',

    'In modern infrastructure, internal communication is often the largest and most vulnerable attack surface. In the absence of Zero Trust controls, attackers who breach one service have the ability to extend their attacks laterally, gain access to sensitive data, and escalate their attacks. For regulatory frameworks like PCI DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA, protection of internal communication is becoming increasingly necessary in order to comply, and firewall-based controls aren’t enough. Cilium helps you meet these security and compliance demands by enforcing Zero Trust Networking policies that protect every connection, no matter how large or complex your environment becomes.',
