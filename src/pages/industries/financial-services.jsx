Cilium's API-aware network security ensures that these critical APIs can be secured, empowering teams with the toolsets needed to understand and guard against malicious patterns in API calls. Cilium supports L7 policies (e.g., allow HTTP GET /foo) for fine-grained access control to shared API services running common cloud native protocols like HTTP, gRPC, Kafka, etc. Cilium also supports deny-based, cluster-wide, and host-layer firewall network policies.",

These features include identity-aware service to service communication and observability, advanced network policies with native HTTP and DNS protocol support, transparent encryption, and using in-kernel IPsec or WireGuard. Enforcement of TLS via Network Policy allows operators to restrict the allowed TLS SNIs in their network, and provide a more secure environment.',
