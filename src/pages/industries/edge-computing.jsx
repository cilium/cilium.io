    'Enabling Cilium allows us to take advantage its benefits in edge computing environments. We can deploy the application containers where is EdgeCore running and bind Cilium to connect with workloads in the cloud infrastructure. This is because Cilium can also enable WireGuard VPN with transparent encryption of traffic between Cilium-managed endpoints. We can also rely on Cilium Tetragon Security Observability and Runtime Enforcement to confine security risk and vulnerability in edge environment.',
