    'Enabling Cilium allows us to take advantage of its benefits in edge computing environments. We can deploy the application containers where EdgeCore is running and use Cilium to connect with workloads in the cloud. Cilium can also enable WireGuard VPN for transparent encryption of traffic between Cilium-managed endpoints. We also rely on Cilium Tetragon for security observability and runtime enforcement to confine security risks and vulnerabilities in edge environments.',
