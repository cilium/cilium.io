    'The AI revolution is here, and with it comes unprecedented demands on network infrastructure. From training massive language models to serving real-time inference, AI workloads require high-performance networking, robust security, and deep observability. Kubernetes has evolved from just a platform for running workloads like web services and microservices to the ideal platform for supporting the end-to-end lifecycle of large artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads.',
    'Cilium is the cloud native solution for providing, securing, and observing network connectivity between workloads, empowering AI workloads to thrive in cloud native environments. Organizations ranging from artificial intelligence research institutions that build sophisticated training models to financial institutions and startups rely on Cilium to support their distributed AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes.',

    'Managing connections across different cloud storage providers was cumbersome. We needed a solution that could simplify this complexity and reduce costs. By leveraging Cilium’s eBPF capabilities, we maintained high-performance networking while completely removing unpredictable traffic costs. Speed is everything in our business; if we can move goods efficiently and forecast demand accurately, we win. Cilium has become a cornerstone of our strategy. It’s not just a tool; it’s a game-changer.',

    'Ascend.io uses Cilium Transparent Encryption to support their use of Apache Spark, the analytics engine for large-scale data processing.',
  quotedText:
    'Spark was the other reason that Cilium became a killer feature that we needed to roll out across every cloud. Spark is a great tool, but sometimes their built in encryption will fail at random. Statistically, at some point it will crash so if you’re dealing with a 12 hour job, it’s gonna fail on hour 11 and that is a terrible thing to try to explain to the customer. Cilium with IPsec doesn’t have that problem. Why have Spark be doing encryption when what we really want Spark to be doing is processing data. We chose to have a reasonable isolation of priorities and responsibilities and have Spark be focused on data processing and have the network layer that is responsible for encryption.',

Scaling infrastructure to meet these demands without overspending or inefficiently allocating resources is a significant challenge for operators. The ability to scale up and down depending on the resource demand is one of the most significant advantages Kubernetes brings to AI/ML. Cilium further enhances this advantage, empowering you to scale AI workloads efficiently. Cilium’s advanced load balancing and traffic management capabilities ensure your AI applications can scale dynamically without disruption. By optimizing resource allocation and reducing overhead, Cilium helps you maximize the ROI of your AI/ML investments.',
