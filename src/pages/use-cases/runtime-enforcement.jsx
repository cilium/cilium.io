    "Tetragon enables transparent security observability and real-time runtime enforcement through its eBPF-based technology. It provides deep visibility without requiring changes to the application and operates with low overhead through in-kernel filtering and aggregation logic built into the eBPF-based kernel-level collector. Tetragon's embedded runtime enforcement layer offers access control capabilities at various enforcement levels, including system call control. ",

  description:
    'Tetragon is Kubernetes-aware, meaning it recognizes Kubernetes identities like namespaces and pods. This enables security event detection that can be tailored to individual workloads. Using eBPF, Tetragon can access the Linux kernel state and combine it with Kubernetes awareness and user policy to generate rules that are enforced by the kernel in real-time. This allows for capabilities like process namespace and capabilities annotation and enforcement, process file descriptor to filename association, and socket to process control.',
