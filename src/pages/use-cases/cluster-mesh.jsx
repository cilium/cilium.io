  subHeading: 'Seamless connectivity for multiple Kubernetes clusters',
  description:
    'Multi-cluster Kubernetes setups are often adopted for reasons like fault isolation, scalability, and geographical distribution. This approach can lead to networking complexities. Traditional networking models, in this context, struggle with service discovery, network segmentation, policy enforcement, and load balancing across clusters. Additionally, managing security protocols and policies across multiple environments can be a challenging endeavour due to the distributed nature of services.',

  title: "Cluster Mesh - Cilium's Multi-Cluster Networking Implementation",
  description:
    'Cilium Cluster Mesh allows you to connect the networks of multiple clusters in such as way that pods in each cluster can discover and access services in all other clusters of the mesh, provided all the clusters run Cilium as their CNI. This allows effectively joining multiple clusters into a large unified network, regardless of the Kubernetes distribution or location each of them is running.',

const sectionContent2 = {
  title: 'High Availability and Fault Tolerance',
  description:
    'Cluster Mesh enhances your services high availability and fault tolerance. It supports the operation of Kubernetes clusters in multiple regions or availability zones. If resources become temporarily unavailable, are misconfigured in one cluster, or offline for upgrades, it enables failover to other clusters, ensuring your services remain accessible at all times.',

const sectionContent3 = {
  title: 'Transparent Service Discovery',
  description:
    'Cluster Mesh automates service discovery across your Kubernetes clusters. Using standard Kubernetes services, it automatically merges services with identical names and namespaces across clusters into a global service. This means your applications can discover and interact with services, irrespective of the cluster they reside in, greatly simplifying cross-cluster communication.  ',

  title: 'Effortless Pod IP Routing',
  description:
    'Cluster Mesh is able to handle Pod IP routing across multiple Kubernetes clusters at native performance. By using either tunneling or direct-routing, it circumvents the need for any gateways or proxies. This allows your pods to communicate across clusters seamlessly, enhancing the overall efficiency of your microservice architecture.  ',

      'Cilium Cluster Mesh configuration was easy, requiring only basic VPC peering, routing tables, and firewalling setup. We directed Cilium to the etcd endpoints in the other clusters, but it now supports CRD-backed IPAM mode. We have deployed Cilium in over 20 Kubernetes production clusters, with at least 3 clusters per game in the same configuration. This infrastructure handles over 50k client requests per second and supports millions of daily active users.',
