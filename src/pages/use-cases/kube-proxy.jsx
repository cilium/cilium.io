    'IPtables and Netfilter are the two foundational technologies of kube-proxy for implementing the Service abstraction. They carry legacy accumulated over 20 years of development grounded in more traditional networking environments that are typically far more static than your average Kubernetes cluster. In the age of cloud native, they are no longer the best tool for the job, especially in terms of performance, reliability, scalability, and operations.',

    'Cilium’s control and data plane has been built from the ground up for large-scale and highly dynamic cloud native environments where 100s and even 1000s of containers are created and destroyed within seconds. Cilium’s control plane is highly optimized, running in Kubernetes clusters of up to 5K nodes and 100K pods. Cilium’s data plane uses eBPF for efficient load-balancing and incremental updates, avoiding the pitfalls of large IPtables rulesets.',

  description:
    'If you already have kube-proxy running as a DaemonSet, transitioning to Cilium is a breeze. Replacing kube-proxy with Cilium is a straightforward process, as Cilium provides a Kubernetes-native implementation that is fully compatible with the Kubernetes API. Existing Kubernetes applications and configurations can continue to work seamlessly with Cilium. ',
