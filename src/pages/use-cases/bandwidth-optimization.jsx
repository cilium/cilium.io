    "Kubernetes lacks native traffic control capabilities, making Traffic Rate-Limiting essential for optimal resource consumption and to prevent bandwidth exhaustion. While Kubernetes does offer Bandwidth Rate-Limiting, it is still experimental and can have detrimental effects on latency. Furthermore, connecting to external-facing Kubernetes clusters may result in a poor user experience due to most TCP congestion protocols not being designed for today's diverse networks.",

  description:
    "Cilium BIG TCP allows for larger packets than the traditional 64KB limit by leveraging IPv6's Hop-by-Hop header, which can specify payload lengths up to 512KB. This is particularly useful for organizations building networks capable of 100Gbps and beyond. BIG TCP does not require modifying the MTU on network devices, making it easier to implement than Jumbo Frames. With BIG TCP, Cilium offers enhanced network performance for nodes, enabling users to extract as much performance as possible from the network.",
