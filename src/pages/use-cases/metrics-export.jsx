    'Metrics alone may lack context for effective issue diagnosis. Configuring metrics exporters and integrating them with monitoring systems can be error-prone and manual. Inadequate, inconsistent, or incorrect metrics can  be misleading, resulting in incorrect conclusions about the application state. Troubleshooting often requires correlating metrics with traces for a comprehensive system understanding.  ',

  description:
    "Cilium's Metrics and Tracing export feature provides a seamless and integrated solution empowering users to monitor, analyze, and optimize their Kubernetes environments with ease. By leveraging the power of Prometheus metrics, combined with Hubble's network behavior insights, Cilium enables users to gain deep visibility into their applications and network while simplifying the setup and configuration process. Cilium also integrates with various tracing systems, such as Jaeger, Zipkin, and OpenTelemetry, to provide distributed tracing capabilities. Cilium is optimized to handle high data volumes without compromising on performance.",

  title: 'Comprehensive and Rich Set of Metrics',
  description:
    'Cilium captures a plethora of metrics, including latency, request rates, and error rates for your applications. These metrics are exported in a standardized Prometheus format, which can be easily integrated with your existing monitoring and visualization tools, enabling you to track your network performance in real-time.',
